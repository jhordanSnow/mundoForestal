This [Yii2] plugin provides easy theming for Yii2 projects.
And allows to create and use themes as composer packages.
So changing a theme on a site becomes as simple as changing
a single require line in `composer.json`.

At the moment there are several themes available:

- AdminLte          - [yii2-theme-adminlte]
- Agency            - [yii2-theme-agency]
- DataServ          - [yii2-theme-dataserv]
- Flat              - [yii2-theme-flat]
- Hyde              - [yii2-theme-hyde]
- Obaju             - [yii2-theme-obaju]
- Yii2 original     - [yii2-theme-original]
- Sailor            - [yii2-theme-sailor]
- Twenty Fifteen    - [yii2-theme-twentyfifteen]

## Installation

This package is not intended to be required directly in your project.
Instead you should require theme(s) you've chosen and this package
will get required as a dependency.

Please see [hiqdev/hisite-template] as example of project using this theming
library.

## Idea

The main goal of this theming library is to allow creation and use of easy
pluggable themes: to change a theme on a site it is enough just to require
other theme package in project's `composer.json`.

To achieve this goal several technologies were used:

- [Yii2 theming] with `pathMap` auto assembling;
- [Yii2 dependency injection] for widgets and menus;
- [composer-config-plugin] to create themes as plugins i.e. code combined and distributed
  together with configuration.

This package provides:

- bootrstrappable `ThemeManager` component that collects and setups in application view
  proper `Theme` object with proper `pathMap`;
- widgets and menus that can be configured through params and substituted with DI;
- theme `DebugPanel` showing actual `pathMap`.
