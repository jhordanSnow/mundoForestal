        This [Yii2] plugin provides easy theming for Yii2 projects.
        And allows to create and use themes as composer packages.
        So changing a theme on a site becomes as simple as changing
        a single require line in `composer.json`.

        At the moment there are several themes available:

        - AdminLte          - [yii2-theme-adminlte]
        - Agency            - [yii2-theme-agency]
